# Multi-Feature Underwater Image Enhancement Method via Embedded Fusion Mechanism (MFEF)
Reproduced paper "[Multi-view underwater image enhancement method via embedded fusion mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.105946)" (2021) by Jingchun Zhou, Jiaming Sun, Weishi Zhang, Zifan Lin by Sander Britton, Kasper Vaessen, Niels Mateijsen and Wouter BÃ¼thker.

## Setting up

Before running `main.py`, the Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark ([UIEB](https://li-chongyi.github.io/proj_benchmark.html)) dataset must be downloaded. This consists of two folders: "distorted" and "enhanced"; these should be inserted into the folder `data/input`. NOTE: the folder names can also be changed in `main.py`.
